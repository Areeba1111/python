This code is a simple GUI program written in Python using the tkinter library. It allows the user to select two currencies and an amount, and then converts the amount from one currency to another using the current exchange rate obtained from an API.

The program first imports the necessary libraries - tkinter, tkinter as tk, ttk, and requests. It then defines two functions: conv() and rst(). The conv() function sends a GET request to an API to obtain the latest exchange rates, performs a currency conversion calculation based on the selected currencies and amount, and displays the converted currency amount as a label on the GUI. The rst() function resets the GUI form.

Next, the program creates the root window and sets its title and padding. It creates labels and entry fields for the amount to be converted, the currency to convert from, and the currency to convert to. It also creates a drop-down menu for selecting the currencies, a button for converting the amount, and a button for resetting the input and output fields.

Finally, the program enters the main event loop using the mainloop() method of the root window, which displays the GUI and waits for user input.
